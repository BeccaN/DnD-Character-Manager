# layout.erb
  - add in clean error display

# users/show.erb
  - add in edit user details option?

# characters/edit.erb & new.erb
  - center
  - better spacing/padding
  - make forms tighter and less 'pre 2000' looking


# characters/show.erb
  - picture on left/details on right
  - div background colors to help seperate the different sections
  - maybe make it look like a journal opened up?
